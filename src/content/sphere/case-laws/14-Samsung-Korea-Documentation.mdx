{/* # Samsung: Documentation Masterclass – Audit-Ready Beats Aggressive Benchmarks */}

## Extended Background

The Korean electronics sector thrives on cross-border supply chains, with Samsung routinely exporting components to group affiliates. As TP audits grew more aggressive regionally, documentation quality became the decisive factor—sometimes more so than statistical benchmarks.

## Detailed Arguments

### Taxpayer

- Presented granular, transaction-level documentation, carefully mapping actual business activities to market data.

- Used independent benchmarks directly tied to subsidiary pricing and risk, not just broad averages.

### Tax Authority

- Challenged prices as too low based on general third-party sales in the market, favoring high statistical targets.

### Court Reasoning

- Gave full weight to taxpayer’s documentation and real-world comparability, overruling generalized industry averages.

## Procedural Journey

- Reversal of a major audit adjustment; taxpayer completely exonerated on appeal.

## Implications Beyond the Case

- Confirmed across Asia: audit survival is about “substance in the paperwork,” not just nominal compliance.

- MNEs must invest in detailed, transaction-specific transfer pricing files.
