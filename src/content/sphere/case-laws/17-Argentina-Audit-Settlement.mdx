{/* # Argentina: Audit Earthquake – From Challenge to Settlement */}

## Extended Background

Economic volatility means Argentine authorities routinely target large corporates for audit, with compliance focused on negotiation rather than drawn-out litigation. MNEs often preferred settling, seeking certainty in an uncertain legal and economic environment.

## Detailed Arguments

### Taxpayer

- Relied on thorough, OECD-aligned documentation to justify tested outcomes but was open to negotiation to minimize risk.

### Revenue

- Used the pressure of costly, protracted audits to drive speedy, tailored settlements.

### Outcome

- Most cases were resolved via confidential, multi-million-dollar settlements; rare for cases to set strict legal precedent.

## Procedural Journey

- Broad “sweep” audits prompted waves of settlement discussions; very few matters tested in higher courts.

## Implications Beyond the Case

- Risk management and high-quality documentation give MNEs crucial leverage in negotiations; certainty may trump a full legal fight in some markets.
