{/* # Watsons Malaysia: Lending Clarity – Arm's Length Proved by Market Offers */}

## Extended Background

Retail MNEs need working capital, often sourced via intercompany loans. Watsons structured group financing based on actual third-party bank offers, defending this as market-standard. Malaysian revenue authorities, fearing base erosion, frequently challenged group loan rates as too low before recent financial transaction guidelines.

## Detailed Arguments

### Taxpayer

- Produced contemporaneous bank loan quotes and detailed risk assessments as the arm’s-length basis for their group loan rates.

- Defended full deductibility and economic rationale for the interest applied.

### Revenue

- Attempted to force higher, “protective” rates despite lack of market comparables.

### Court Reasoning

- Ruled for Watsons: market-based interest, properly documented, fulfills arm’s-length requirements.

## Procedural Journey

- Dispute moved from audit to litigation, resolved in Watsons’ favor with full expense deductibility restored.

## Implications Beyond the Case

- MNEs in Malaysia are now safer using actual loan offers and risk data—statistical “rate padding” by tax authorities is less defendable.
