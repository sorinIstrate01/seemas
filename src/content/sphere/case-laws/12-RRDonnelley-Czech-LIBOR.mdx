{/* # RR Donnelley (Czech Republic): LIBOR Loan Analogy Disputed */}

## Extended Background

In the Czech industrial sector, RR Donnelley’s local operations made frequent intercompany purchases from group entities. Authorities, amid a regional clampdown on profit shifting, began treating these payment terms as loans, applying LIBOR interest benchmarks—a trend growing across Central and Eastern Europe pre-OECD BEPS financial reforms.

## Detailed Arguments

### Taxpayer

- Maintained these were standard procurement payables, not credit-risk transactions or disguised loans.

- Cited routine commercial behavior, arguing comparability analyses showed third parties would not impute LIBOR-based interest here.

### Tax Authority

- Characterized payment delays as risk-free loans, imposing notional interest and penalties.

- Relied on the argument that any “free” capital in the group should be priced as a financial transaction.

### Court Reasoning

- Both appellate and supreme courts agreed with RR Donnelley: lacking economic comparability and no real lending function, these payables could not just be recharacterized as loans.

## Procedural Journey

- Tax adjustment and penalty imposed, challenged by appeals, resolved with full exoneration by the Czech Supreme Administrative Court.

## Implications Beyond the Case

- Reinforces that intercompany terms must be benchmarked against real, arm’s-length business practice—not just assumed financial instruments.

- MNEs should thoroughly document commercial rationale for payment terms, especially where working capital liquidity is at issue.
