{/* # Sandakan Edible Oils (Malaysia): Defending the Safe Harbor – In-Range vs. Median */}

## Extended Background

Malaysia’s export industries often rely on transfer pricing safe harbors through arms-length ranges (IQR). Sandakan Edible Oils, like many regional firms, set its reported profits within this range, even if not always at the median. Before BEPS/TP refinement, tax authorities were increasingly tempted to adjust results toward maximum revenue using the median alone.

## Detailed Arguments

### Taxpayer

- Cited both local and OECD rules affirming that any result within the IQR is compliant, not just the median.

- Supported its margins with full benchmarking and robust functional analysis.

### Tax Authority

- Argued government revenue was best protected by always targeting the median, seeking higher assessed income.

### Court Reasoning

- Clearly rejected the “median or bust” argument, stating the rules intend a range for a reason.

- Upheld that as long as margins are in-range, compliance is achieved.

## Procedural Journey

- Assessment raised, litigated in court, with a full victory for the taxpayer, no upward adjustment applied.

## Implications Beyond the Case

- Locked in the IQR as true safe harbor; authorities must accept any in-range result barring proof of manipulation.

- For MNEs: strong benchmarking can defend even non-median results.
