{/* # Mopani Copper Zambia: Benchmarking and Africa’s New Assertiveness */}

## Extended Background

Resource extraction MNEs, including Mopani, were traditionally able to shift profits abroad using related-party trading companies. Zambia’s challenge marked a turning point, with support from the OECD to strengthen local capacity and implement real benchmarking in mining.

## Detailed Arguments

### Taxpayer

- Pointed to global copper pricing volatility, arguing that “in-market” trading and logistics justified discount pricing to affiliates.

- Presented internal documents justifying the structure.

### Revenue

- Provided independent global pricing indices and shipping evidence to argue for higher value retention in Zambia.

### Outcome

- Zambian authorities won a landmark $13M adjustment, signaling a new era of evidence-based enforcement.

## Procedural Journey

- Case developed via major audits and international peer support, resolved domestically without lengthy litigation.

## Implications Beyond the Case

- Other African extractives must rigorously document pricing decisions and expect much higher scrutiny on transfer values.
