{/* # South Africa: Royalties Must Ring Arm’s-Length True */}

## Extended Background

IP-rich sectors in South Africa have long relied on affiliate royalty arrangements, but local courts increasingly scrutinized the basis and benchmarking of such charges. This case featured a taxpayer defending arm’s-length royalty rates using deep market research amid revenue challenges based on rough averages.

## Detailed Arguments

### Taxpayer

- Supplied direct benchmarks from global royalty databases and contract samples.

### Revenue

- Relied on averages and sectoral “rough justice” in the absence of deep comparability testing.

### Court Reasoning

- Backed the taxpayer, dismissing low-quality comparables and demanding robust, like-for-like market benchmarks.

## Procedural Journey

- Typical audit/adjustment-judicial review escalation, ending with a win for the taxpayer.

## Implications Beyond the Case

- Across Africa, genuine benchmarking is now the standard—broad averages are out.
