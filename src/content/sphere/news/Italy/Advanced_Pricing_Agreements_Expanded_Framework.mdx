Taxpayers can seek unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral APAs under Articles 31-ter and 31-quater of Presidential Decree 600/1973, with the aim of reducing disputes and providing certainty over multi-year transfer pricing positions. Procedures are coordinated with the latest OECD BEPS recommendations.
