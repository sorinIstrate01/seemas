# Mandatory Master File, Local File, and Informative Return

Multinational groups and domestic taxpayers must file the annual Informative Return on Related Parties (Annex 9 of DIEMSE), with Master and Local File documentation due by the tax return deadline (generally March 31 of the following year). These must meet the extensive SAT and OECD content requirements.
